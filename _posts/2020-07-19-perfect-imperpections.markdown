I am starting this blog to talk about many things. Hopefully it will
make some sense, since it will probably end up covering a wide range
of topics not necessarily related to each other in any way.

For a long time, I was reluctant to finally get started with it.  I
love writing, but I was afraid that the blog would not be as good as
it should. I wanted to be completely ready to start it before I
actually did. So I never did.

But then I came across an idea, a philosophy, which helped me change
my mind about needing to have everything perfect: it is an oriental
concept called `wabi-sabi` (I really recommend this [video] made by
The School of Life).

Many times we talk about accepting that things will often not be as
good as we would like them to be. Life is not perfect. We have to
accept that, or we will live in constant frustration. Objects are
imperfect too: nothing can remain in pristine condition
forever. Everything changes. If we accept that, we can move on.

But wabi-sabi is more than just accepting the imperfections: it is the
realization that a crack in a cup has its own beauty. It tells a
story. As the video I linked above says, wabi-sabi is a respect for
the fragility of things.

Because nothing can be perfect, at least not forever, this is a very
intelligent frame of mind to have.

My blog will never be perfect. But as long as it can have some use to
at least some people out there, I can certainly love it.

I like many things, and I do many things as well. I am a web developer
and a translator, and I will talk about these things here. I will
write about Emacs, my favorite editor ever and the tool I am using to
write right now. I like free software, and I hope to provide useful
information about that as well.

I am also on my way to becoming and entrepreneur, and since this journey
will probably teach me a lot, I will try to share my insights here.

Moreover, I intend to write about things I am reading about and
learning. This will help me, as the blog can serve as a reference for
myself later on. But I will make it available online, rather than just
keeping it as a private resource, hoping that other people may find
these pieces of writing useful.

And since you are here, I hope that you enjoy a bit of my (im)perfect
imperfections.
